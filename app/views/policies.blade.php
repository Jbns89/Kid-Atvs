<p>Note: Here at kid-atvs.com we are committed to safe use of our off road vehicles. Our atvs meet or exceed the ANSI Standard http://www.ansi.org/ as required by law (SIA of 2008). In the interest of safe use of youth model atvs we have removed "toy type" lights in order to discourage night riding and conform to government mandated regulations.</p>


<h3>Return Policy</h3>
<p>We sell all of our products at wholesale pricing and include the shipping cost in the price of each unit. So "reversing" a sale can be costly, but we of course want you to be completely satisfied. If you wish to "reverse" a sale, then just return it to us within 7 days of the day you sign and accept the unit, You may, at your own expense, return any items found to be defective to us. This applies only to items you find defective upon initial examination. (Immediately upon assembly) We will not accept back any item which has been used in any way. As well as a 20% restocking fee. After that 7 days there is no option to return your unit for any reason.  If there is an issue with your ATV let us know and we can get you tech help and any part you need to repair your unit.  Defective parts are usually replaced at no charge to you. Be sure that you look at the descriptions of the units as well as read over ALL of the warranties and policies that are posted clearly on the website before you purchase.  By purchasing anything from the website you agree to follow all warranties and policies posted.</p>

<p>Fair, straight forward , and no small print. That’s how we do business.</p>
 
<h3>Shipping </h3>
<p>We pack everything, test, and crate it before it leaves our warehouse. We do this so if you get a crate and it is damaged, then the fault lies with the shipping company. Because lets be real... when we ship anything, no matter how small or big or how well its packaged, there is always a chance of shipping damage. It is rare but sometimes a unit will receive cosmetic damage while in transit from the shipping company, 99% of the time it is just a piece of plastic here or there and we will file a claim with the shipping company and send your new parts out asap. Buy signing for your shipment you are obviously accepting the unit and authorizing us to send you any replacement parts damaged during shipping. </p>


<h3>Terms On All Sales:</h3>
<p>All sales are considered final. First choice colors of units ordered at most times can be accommodated, however during busy and peak seasons, first choice colors aren’t guaranteed which is why having a back up color choice is important. If for any reason a color is not available that you have specified you will be contacted. Some models may arrive slightly different than the one pictured as models are updated through out the year for safety reasons. We always try to the keep the most current pictures of models on the web site. An inferior model will never be sent! If you have specific needs ask your rep to send you a current picture of the model in question.</p>
