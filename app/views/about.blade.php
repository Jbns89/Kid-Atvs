    <h2>About Us:</h2>
    <p class="about">As simple as this sounds. This is what we are all about here at KID-ATVs.com. 
        Our operation is a simple one. You pay and your order ships immediately! Our ship time 
        is approx. 5-7 days. Most of our competitors take 10 to 15 days to fulfill an order 
        or longer, sometimes months! This is not the case here. When we contact you for your 
        order we know exactly what we have in stock and are ready to ship, thus, minimizing wait 
        times. Here at Kid-ATVs.com Inc., we are long time motor sports fans. We work diligently 
        to find manufacturers who sell quality as well as affordability. We feel it is our 
        <strong>obligation</strong> to do this on behalf of our customers. Our determination is to provide 
        <strong>superior</strong> products at reasonable prices. We <strong>know service is imperative</strong>, so we've made 
        the decision to hire only trained professionals who are familiar with our products and 
        standards. The result is an outstanding product, affordable prices and <span class="text-uppercase"><strong>great service</strong></span>.</p>
